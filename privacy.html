        <p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> The information we collect is used for billing and to provide service and support to our customers.  We may study this information to determine our customers’ needs and to promote certain products and services or additional support.

        <p><strong>Log Files.</strong> We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site and servers, track access, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. However, it is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Surveys</strong> We may use the contact and other information provided to follow up with customers who respond to our customer surveys to help resolve issues internally or with our third party partners.  For example, HostGator may contact customers based on their survey answers or to highlight certain changes we made in response to customer feedback.</p>

We may share your information with these parties to offer the product or service or to facilitate your use of additional amenities included with your hosting account.  For example, one of our partners may provide services to you based on links that you access from your control panel.</p>
        <p>We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to potential partners, reputable third parties and other companies or brands within our corporate family.  We will only share your information with third parties that agree to maintain your information in confidence and to use it solely for purposes of providing the product or service as agreed to by HostGator.</p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties that help us provide our services or provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to authorize and process payments, administer surveys, or run promotions. Your personal information may be maintained and processed by our third party service providers in the United States or in other jurisdictions. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Online Advertisements.</strong> We do not share personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers. We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our customers that we collect through the registration process or through online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. In some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell us the audience they want to reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Surveys.</strong> We may share customer information obtained from customer surveys within HostGator and our corporate family, and with trusted third parties to develop or provide products and services that we believe would be of interest to our customers.</p>
        <p><strong>Domain Registration.</strong> In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, the contact information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and expiration date.  The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches. At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from HostGator and we do not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, HostGator is required to make WHOIS data available to any third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. While ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain management console or similar service) of having their WHOIS information made available to third parties through bulk access, companies, such as ours, businesses, and other organizations do not have the ability to opt-out of having their information made available to a third party that enters a bulk access agreement. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Law Enforcement and Special Cases.</strong> We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about users upon a valid request by government or law officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect your property and rights, or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to stop activity that we consider illegal or unethical.</p>

					<p>HostGator is committed to making it easy to transfer your site to your new hosting account. We can transfer website files, databases, scripts, and  one free domain registration transfer.</p>
					<h5>What qualifies me for a free transfer?</h5>
					<p>HostGator provides free transfers for new accounts <strong>within 30 days of sign-up</strong>, and to newly upgraded accounts. For upgraded accounts it must be an inter-server upgrade to qualify. Please note that downgraded accounts do not qualify for free transfers.</p>
					<p>Depending on which type of account you sign up for, we offer differing numbers of free transfers. Please refer to the chart below to see what we include for new packages.</p>
					<p><strong>Full cPanel Transfers</strong> is the number of cPanel to cPanel transfers that are included.</p>
					<p><strong>Max. Manual Transfers</strong> is the maximum number of Manual Transfers that are included with your account.</p>
					<p><strong>Total Free Transfers</strong> is the total number websites that we will move for you.</p>

<br />Please submit the <a href='https://secure.hostgator.com/resellertransferdedicated.php'>online form</a> to initiate your website content transfers.
<br />VPS accounts that have a control panel (either cPanel or Plesk) qualify for unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, or up to 10 <a href='index.html#manual_transfer'>Manual Transfers</a> per VPS level. I.E. a Level 5 VPS qualifies for 50 manual transfers, while a Level 7 qualifies for 70 manual transfers.
<br />(Snappy 500 or VPS without a control panel)
<br />VPS accounts with no control panel are for advanced Linux customers who are comfortable with installing and configuring their own services. If you would like us to transfer their data to such a VPS (or a Dedicated server with no control panel), you would be responsible for making sure that their services are configured correctly and will need to inform us exactly where the data needs to be placed (we will not configure or restore anything, but only copy files or packages to the specified directory on the VPS/server). If you are not comfortable with installing and configuring their own services, we suggest upgrading to a Level 3 plan with cPanel. We will not be able to install and configure each service for you. If a Level 3 package is too expensive, then a Reseller or Shared account might work based upon your needs.">?</span>

					<p><sup>1</sup>While we can do unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers for you, depending on your account, you will have a limited number of Manual Transfers.</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup>Full cPanel transfers include all domains, Addon Domains, Subdomains, and cPanel settings. This will also include your emails and email accounts. Please note that this does require that your old host's cPanel backup generator to be active.</p>
					<p>A few examples: An Aluminum Reseller account includes up to 30 free transfers. Out of this 30, you can have 20 cPanel to cPanel transfers and 10 Manual Transfers, or any combination of the two that totals 30 or less websites. Another example: A Pro Dedicated server includes unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, this means you can have 150 sites (or even more) moved. Also since there is an unlimited total number of transfers, you can utilize up to 100 Manual Transfers.</p>

					<h5>How much disk space and bandwidth will my plan include?</h5>
					<p>There are no set limits on the disk space or data transfer (bandwidth) that we provide in our shared and reseller hosting plans. We want you to have the resources you need to build a great online presence.</p>
					<p>That being said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website. While it is rare, we may need to put constraints on accounts that are using resources that impact other customers on the same server.</p>
					<p>Typically, customers only run into issues if they use their accounts for storage or file sharing, which is not what our services are intended to support. In accordance with our Terms of Services the disk space and bandwidth you use must be integrated into the normal operation of your website.</p>
					<p>For Example, customers who are affecting other clients or are using 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds would be in violation. Please see our TOS or contact us for complete details and restrictions.</p>
					<h5>What happens if I exceed usage?</h5>
					<p>If we have concerns about your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage.</p>
					<p>Again, it is very rare for a customer who is managing a personal or small business website to exceed our usage policies.</p>
