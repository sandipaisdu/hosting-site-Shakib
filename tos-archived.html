              Use of the Services is also governed by the following policies, which are incorporated by reference. By using the Services, you also agree to the terms of the following policies.

            <li>Additional terms may also apply to certain Services, and are incorporated by reference herein as applicable.  For example, if you register a domain name with us, then the Domain Registration Agreement will also apply to you and would be incorporated herein.</li>

          <strong>Account Eligibility</strong>
          <ol class="alpha">
            <li>
              By registering for or using the Services, you represent and warrant that:
              <ol class="lower-roman">
                <li>You are eighteen (18) years of age or older.  The Services are intended solely for Users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older. Any registration, use of or access to the Services, by anyone under eighteen (18) is unauthorized and is a violation of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>If you use the Services on behalf of another party you agree that you are authorized to bind such other party to this Agreement and to act on such other party’s behalf with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Services.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to provide accurate, current, and complete information on the registration forms, including an email address that is different from the domain you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, we will use the primary email address we have on file. It is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your account, including any domain accounts is accurate, correct and complete at all times. HostGator is not responsible for any lapse in the Services, including without limitation, any lapsed domain registrations due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain. If you need to verify or change your contact information, please contact our sales team via email or update your contact information through the HostGator Billing and Support System. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or certain other cases, you may be required to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for verification purposes. Failure to provide the information requested may result in your order being denied.</li>
            <li>You agree to be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place through your account.  It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password and other information related to the security of your account.</li>
            <li>Any dedicated IP order in addition to those provided with a hosting package may be subject to IP justification.  IP justification practices are subject to change to remain in compliance with the policies of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). We reserve the right to deny any dedicated IP request based on insufficient justification or current IP utilization.</li>

          <strong>Transfers</strong>
          <br />Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move your website to us. Transfers are provided as a courtesy service.  We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data.  In some cases we may not be able to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The free transfer service is available for thirty (30) days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the thirty (30) day period will incur a charge; please contact a member of our Transfers department to receive a price quote.  In no event shall HostGator be held liable for any lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to or from HostGator. <strong>You are solely responsible for backing up your data in all circumstances.</strong>

              <hr />Once we receive your cancellation form and have confirmed all necessary information with you via email, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled.

We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed.
              <hr />Cancellations for shared and reseller accounts will be effective on the account’s renewal date.  Cancellations for dedicated and VPS accounts will be effective immediately.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, HOSTGATOR'S LIABILITY TO YOU, OR ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO HOSTGATOR FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.  THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT.  THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indemnification</strong>
          <br />You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless HostGator, our affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, suits, actions, demands, proceedings (whether legal or administrative), and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) threatened, asserted, or filed by a third party against any of the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Services, (ii) any breach or violation by you of this Agreement; or (iii) any acts or omissions by you. The terms of this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arbitration</strong>
          <br />By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement.  The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator chosen by HostGator and will be held at the AAA location chosen by HostGator in Texas. Payment of all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.  In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, HostGator will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.  The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this paragraph.  All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and HostGator alone.  Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against HostGator in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay HostGator’s reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Independent Contractor</strong>
          <br />HostGator and User are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement places HostGator and User in the relationship of principal and agent, partners or joint venturers. Neither party has, expressly or by implication, or may represent itself as having, any authority to make contracts or enter into any agreements in the name of the other party, or to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong>
          <br />Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the formation of this Agreement or the breach of this Agreement, including any claim based upon an alleged tort, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Texas. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

        <li>
          <strong>Disclaimer</strong>

          <strong>Backups and Data Loss</strong>
          <br />Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. HostGator’s backup service runs once a week and overwrites any of our previous backups. Only one week of backups are kept at a time.

HostGator does not maintain backups of dedicated accounts. HostGator is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for all files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on HostGator’s servers.
          <hr />Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive to help protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.

          <strong>Waiver</strong>
          <br />No failure or delay by you or HostGator to exercise any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of any right or remedy.

        <li>
          <strong>Assignment; Successors</strong>
          <br />You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of HostGator.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Force Majeure</strong>
          <br />Neither party is liable for any default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than failure to make payments when due) if such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by forces beyond such party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, acts of God, labor disputes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, interruptions of transportation or communications, supply shortages or the failure of any third party to perform any commitment relative to the production or delivery of any equipment or material required for such party to perform its obligations hereunder.

          <strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries</strong>
          <br />Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed to confer any rights in any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, user acknowledges and agrees that any supplier of a third-party product or service that is identified as a third-party beneficiary in the service description, is an intended third-party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in this Agreement as they relate specifically to its products or services and shall have the right to enforce directly the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to its products or services against user as if it were a party to this Agreement.

					<h5>What qualifies me for a free transfer?</h5>
					<p>HostGator provides free transfers for new accounts <strong>within 30 days of sign-up</strong>, and to newly upgraded accounts. For upgraded accounts it must be an inter-server upgrade to qualify. Please note that downgraded accounts do not qualify for free transfers.</p>
					<p>Depending on which type of account you sign up for, we offer differing numbers of free transfers. Please refer to the chart below to see what we include for new packages.</p>
					<p><strong>Full cPanel Transfers</strong> is the number of cPanel to cPanel transfers that are included.</p>
					<p><strong>Max. Manual Transfers</strong> is the maximum number of Manual Transfers that are included with your account.</p>
					<p><strong>Total Free Transfers</strong> is the total number websites that we will move for you.</p>

<br />Please submit the <a href='https://secure.hostgator.com/resellertransferdedicated.php'>online form</a> to initiate your website content transfers.
<br />VPS accounts that have a control panel (either cPanel or Plesk) qualify for unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, or up to 10 <a href='index.html#manual_transfer'>Manual Transfers</a> per VPS level. I.E. a Level 5 VPS qualifies for 50 manual transfers, while a Level 7 qualifies for 70 manual transfers.
<br />(Snappy 500 or VPS without a control panel)
<br />VPS accounts with no control panel are for advanced Linux customers who are comfortable with installing and configuring their own services. If you would like us to transfer their data to such a VPS (or a Dedicated server with no control panel), you would be responsible for making sure that their services are configured correctly and will need to inform us exactly where the data needs to be placed (we will not configure or restore anything, but only copy files or packages to the specified directory on the VPS/server). If you are not comfortable with installing and configuring their own services, we suggest upgrading to a Level 3 plan with cPanel. We will not be able to install and configure each service for you. If a Level 3 package is too expensive, then a Reseller or Shared account might work based upon your needs.">?</span>

					<p><sup>1</sup>While we can do unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers for you, depending on your account, you will have a limited number of Manual Transfers.</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup>Full cPanel transfers include all domains, Addon Domains, Subdomains, and cPanel settings. This will also include your emails and email accounts. Please note that this does require that your old host's cPanel backup generator to be active.</p>
					<p>A few examples: An Aluminum Reseller account includes up to 30 free transfers. Out of this 30, you can have 20 cPanel to cPanel transfers and 10 Manual Transfers, or any combination of the two that totals 30 or less websites. Another example: A Pro Dedicated server includes unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, this means you can have 150 sites (or even more) moved. Also since there is an unlimited total number of transfers, you can utilize up to 100 Manual Transfers.</p>

					<h5>How much disk space and bandwidth will my plan include?</h5>
					<p>There are no set limits on the disk space or data transfer (bandwidth) that we provide in our shared and reseller hosting plans. We want you to have the resources you need to build a great online presence.</p>
					<p>That being said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website. While it is rare, we may need to put constraints on accounts that are using resources that impact other customers on the same server.</p>
					<p>Typically, customers only run into issues if they use their accounts for storage or file sharing, which is not what our services are intended to support. In accordance with our Terms of Services the disk space and bandwidth you use must be integrated into the normal operation of your website.</p>
					<p>For Example, customers who are affecting other clients or are using 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds would be in violation. Please see our TOS or contact us for complete details and restrictions.</p>
					<h5>What happens if I exceed usage?</h5>
					<p>If we have concerns about your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage.</p>
					<p>Again, it is very rare for a customer who is managing a personal or small business website to exceed our usage policies.</p>
